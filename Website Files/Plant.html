<h1 style="text-align: center;"> This is the start of our plant website!</h1>
<p style="color: blue;">here is where we may put a user login, or the website simply connects to the one raspberry pi.<br>
If there is a user login, the user has to connect to the specific raspberry pi's ID, which can be a mess. Definitely better for a 
<br> scenario where many users by this product to let them know when the plant needs to be watered, so user data is kept private and
<br> the website is catered to their specific product.</p>
